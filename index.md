## Documentation Samples



[My Updated E-Utilities API Documentation (In Progress)](https://github.com/jenpetsmit/eutilities/blob/main/getting_started.md)
  - Here is the [link to the **current** E-Utilities API documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/). The documentation was written many years. My task is to re-organize the information and present it in a way that is more easier to understand. The team is not currently equiped to develop a website that enables interactivity, so I am creating a pseudosite here to show how I would organize a website (current as of Dec 2024). I attempted to write my first API yaml, which is included in the link above.

[My Edited SRA Tookit Wiki](https://github.com/jenpetsmit/tk_wiki/wiki)
  - Here is the [link to the **current** SRA Toolkit Wiki](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki). My task was to edit a few pages to serve an audience that includes non-developers. My work is linked above. The team decided the work was too detailed for the GitHub and is currently scheduled to be added to the SRA website.
 
[My Detailed Version of How to Download and Use the STAT Tool](https://github.com/jenpetsmit/STAT_Tool/blob/main/STAT_Tool.md)
  - Here is the [link to the **current** version that does not have instructions to download the databases for personal use](https://github.com/ncbi/ngs-tools/tree/tax/tools/tax). My task here was to create instructions for non-developers to download and use the STAT Tool. The developer team decided the work was too detailed and the project manager is no longer with the company, so the future of this work is on hold.
